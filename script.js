 /* Jamie: You were on the right track by declaring a variable, but what would happen if you created one that was an empty string to start? You could then use a for loop to modify that variable by having it go through the array of quote.
 The last hint I will give you is we will need to put template literals somewhere into play here or the ${}
 
 Austin: ...you can use a for loop to get started and for the 1st statement think about indexes (start with 0). You basically want to create a variable with an empty string and if the variable (i) is less than the total length of the quote variable, you want to add each index to that empty string.
The secret sauce is what is inside the {} after your for loop...the hint I will give is ${}

I would say start with that for loop and know that inside of that you will need at least 2 things, the modulus or % and if/else if/else statements. 
There is a very common interview question called "FizzBuzz" that you might want to look into as well. That's what this question is based off of
